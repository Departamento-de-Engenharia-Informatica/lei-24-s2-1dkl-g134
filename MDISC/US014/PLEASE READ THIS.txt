To the teacher correcting these results,

We must note that the "Execution-Time-Table.csv" file was recorded on an execution of the asymptotic behaviour tests different from the one used for the benchmarking graph files.

As such, you will notice that the results of these two files do not exactly match, and vary greatly towards the later files.

This is to be expected. Do not be confused: These are just hardware differences playing into the execution time of the algorithm on the two different tests.

Additionally, we must remind you that the Execution Time Table is formatted in a "Input Edge Amount ; Execution Time in Nanoseconds" format.
