# System Overview:
GreenGuardian is a handy app designed to make managing green spaces like parks and gardens a breeze.

It's made for different folks involved in green space management, like park admins and staff.

Each user has their own tools:

- The Human Resources Manager (HRM) handles teams and projects.
- The Fleet Manager (FM) takes care of vehicles and equipment.
- Collaborators do design, construction, and maintenance.

Now, the app even helps plan and build irrigation systems, making it quicker and easier.
