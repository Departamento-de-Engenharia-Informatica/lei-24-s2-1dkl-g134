**From the specifications document:**

> The To-Do List comprises all pending tasks for all parks. The entries in
this list describe the required task, the degree of urgency (High, Medium,
and Low), and the approximate expected duration. The Agenda is made
up of entries that relate to a task (which was previously in the To-Do List),
the team that will carry out the task, the vehicles/equipment assigned to
the task, expected duration, and the status (Planned, Postponed, Canceled,
Done).




**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** The collaborator can see what type of entrys? Like what status can he filter ? Can he see canceled Entry's?
> 
> **Answer:** The ones assigned to him. He can filter by the different values the status of the status, like planned, executed, canceled ...
